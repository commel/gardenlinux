# Garden Linux

<website-main>

<img align="left" width="80" height="80" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gardenlinux/gardenlinux/main/logo/gardenlinux-logo-black-text.svg"> <a href="https://gardenlinux.io/">Garden Linux</a> is a <a href="https://debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a> derivate that aims to provide small, auditable Linux images for most cloud providers (e.g. AWS, Azure, GCP etc.) and bare-metal machines. Garden Linux is the best Linux for <a href="https://gardener.cloud/">Gardener</a> nodes. Garden Linux provides great possibilities for customizing that is made by a highly customizable feature set to fit your needs. <br><br>

</website-main>

## Features Overview

Garden Linux is a versatile and secure Debian-based Linux distribution, offering:

- An intuitive and repeatable build system.
- Efficient performance with a small system footprint.
- Strong security features including optional immutable images and latest security standards.
- Extensive testing to ensure reliability and compliance.
- Broad support for major cloud providers, virtualization platforms, and bare-metal installations.

For a complete list of features and detailed use-case descriptions, please see our [Full Feature Matrix](https://github.com/gardenlinux/gardenlinux/tree/main/docs/00_introduction/features.md).


## Quickstart
```
./build metal
./test metal
```

## Full Documentation

For detailed information on Garden Linux click [here](https://github.com/gardenlinux/gardenlinux/tree/main/docs). 
ðŸ“š This resource covers everything from introduction to advanced configurations.

## Build

The build system utilises the [gardenlinux/builder](https://github.com/gardenlinux/builder) to create customized Linux distributions. [gardenlinux/gardenlinux](https://github.com/gardenlinux/gardenlinux) is maintained by the Garden Linux team, highlighting specialized "features" available for other projects.

### Custom Builds
To initiate a build, use the command:
```shell
./build ${platform}-${feature}_${modifier}
```

Where:
- `${platform}` denotes the desired platform (e.g., kvm, metal, aws).
- `${feature}` represents a specific feature from the `features/` folder.
- `${modifier}` is an optional modifier from the `features/` folder, prefixed with an underscore "_".

You can combine multiple platforms, features, and modifiers as needed.

Example:
```shell
./build kvm-python_dev
```

The build script fetches the required builder container and manages all internal build steps. By default, it uses rootless podman, but you can switch to another container engine with the `--container-engine` flag.


### Build Requirements

- **Memory:** The build process may require up to 8GiB of memory, depending on the selected targets. If your system has insufficient RAM, configure swap space accordingly.
- **Container Engine:** The Builder has minimal dependencies and only requires a working container engine. You have two options:
  - **Rootless Podman:** It's recommended to use rootless Podman. Please refer to the [Podman rootless setup guide](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md) for instructions on setting it up.
  - **Sudo Podman:** Alternatively, you can use Podman with sudo for elevated privileges.

To ensure a successful build, please refer to the [Build Requirements section](https://github.com/gardenlinux/builder#requirements) in the `gardenlinux/builder` repository.

### Parallel Builds

For efficient parallel builds of multiple targets, use the `-j ${number_of_threads}` option in the build script. However, note the following:

- Building in parallel significantly increases memory usage.
- There are no mechanisms in place to handle memory exhaustion gracefully.
- This feature is only recommended for users with large build machines, ideally with 8GiB of RAM per builder thread. It may work with 4GiB per thread due to spikes in memory usage being only intermittent during the build, but your milage may vary.

### Cross Architecture Builds

By default, the build targets the native architecture of the build system. However, cross-building for other architectures is simple.

Append the target architecture to the target name in the build command, like so: `./build ${target}-${arch}`.
For example, to build for both amd64 and arm64 architectures:

```
./build kvm-amd64 kvm-arm64
```

This requires setting up [binfmt_misc](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/binfmt-misc.html) handlers for the target architecture, allowing the system to execute foreign binaries.

On most distributions, you can install QEMU user static to set up binfmt_misc handlers. For example, on Debian, use the command `apt install qemu-user-static`.

### SELinux

If you intend to build targets with the `_selinux` feature, some additional requirements apply to the build machine.


Building the `_selinux` feature will not work on machines running in SELinux enforcing mode. Ideally, you should build on a machine with SELinux disabled. However, if you want to build with SELinux in permissive mode, this can be achieved by running the build as root with the `--privileged` flag.

i.e.: `sudo ./build --privileged ${target}`

**SELinux Workaround for Podman:**
> :warning: **Note:** [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io) and [Podman on macOS](https://podman.io) have by default SELinux enabled in their VMs. This may cause issues when building the `_selinux` feature. See [issue #16](https://github.com/gardenlinux/builder/issues/16) for details.

If you're using Podman on macOS, follow these steps to disable SELinux in the podman VM:

1. SSH into the Podman VM: `podman machine ssh`
2. Run the following command to disable SELinux: `echo SELINUX=disabled | sudo tee /etc/selinux/config`
3. Exit the SSH connection.
4. Restart the Podman VM: `podman machine stop && podman machine start`


### Secureboot

If you intend to build targets with the `_secureboot` feature, you must first build the secureboot certificates.
Run the command `./cert/build` to generate the secureboot certificates.

By default, the command uses local files as the private key storage. However, you can configure it to use the AWS KMS key store by using the `--kms` flag. Note that valid AWS credentials need to be configured using the standard AWS environment variables.

### Maintained Images

Garden Linux offers a range of official images tailored for various architectures and platforms. Instead of listing all the specific image variants here, you can find the most up-to-date list of maintained images on the [Garden Linux releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/gardenlinux/gardenlinux/releases).

**Supported Architectures:**
- arm64

To understand the build process for these images, refer to the [build action](https://github.com/gardenlinux/gardenlinux/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml). For details on the publishing process, check out the [upload action](https://github.com/gardenlinux/gardenlinux/blob/main/.github/workflows/upload_to_s3.yml) and the [gardenlinux/glci](https://github.com/gardenlinux/glci) repository.

## Tests

To run local tests for a specific target, use the command `./test ${target}`.

### Platform Tests
Garden Linux supports platform tests for all major cloud platforms (Alicloud, AWS, Azure, GCP). To allow testing even without access to any cloud platform we created an universal `kvm` platform that may run locally and is accessed in the same way via a `ssh client object` as any other cloud platform. Therefore, you do not need to adjust tests to perform  tests locally. This platform is used to perform `unit tests` and will run as a local `integration test`. More details can be found within the documentation in  [tests/README.md](tests/README.md).
