# Garden Linux

<website-main>

<img align="left" width="80" height="80" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gardenlinux/gardenlinux/main/logo/gardenlinux-logo-black-text.svg"> <a href="https://gardenlinux.io/">Garden Linux</a> is a <a href="https://debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a> derivate that aims to provide small, auditable Linux images for most cloud providers (e.g. AWS, Azure, GCP etc.) and bare-metal machines. Garden Linux is the best Linux for <a href="https://gardener.cloud/">Gardener</a> nodes. Garden Linux provides great possibilities for customizing that is made by a highly customizable feature set to fit your needs. <br><br>

</website-main>

Garden Linux is a versatile and secure Debian-based Linux distribution, offering:

- An intuitive and repeatable build system.
- Efficient performance with a small system footprint.
- Strong security features including optional immutable images and latest security standards.
- Extensive testing to ensure reliability and compliance.
- Broad support for major cloud providers, virtualization platforms, and bare-metal installations.

For a complete list of features and detailed use-case descriptions, please see our [Full Feature Matrix](https://github.com/gardenlinux/gardenlinux/tree/main/docs/00_introduction/features.md).


## Quickstart
```
./build metal # Build Garden Linux metal flavor
./test metal # Test Garden Linux metal flavor
```

## Build
To initiate a build, use the command:
```shell
./build ${platform}-${feature}_${modifier}
```

Where:
- `${platform}` denotes the desired platform (e.g., kvm, metal, aws).
- `${feature}` represents a specific feature from the `features/` folder.
- `${modifier}` is an optional modifier from the `features/` folder, prefixed with an underscore "_".

You can combine multiple platforms, features, and modifiers as needed.

Example:
```shell
./build kvm-python_dev
```

The build script fetches the required builder container and manages all internal build steps. By default, it uses rootless podman, but you can switch to another container engine with the `--container-engine` flag.

Further information on how to build Garden Linux can be found [here](https://github.com/gardenlinux/gardenlinux/tree/main/docs/01_developers/build_image.md).

| [Ali](https://github.com/gardenlinux/gardenlinux/tree/main/features/ali) | `ali` |
| [AWS](https://github.com/gardenlinux/gardenlinux/tree/main/features/aws) | `aws` |
| [Azure](https://github.com/gardenlinux/gardenlinux/tree/main/features/azure) | `azure` |
| [GCP](https://github.com/gardenlinux/gardenlinux/tree/main/features/gcp) | `gcp` |

To understand the build process for these images, refer to the [build action](https://github.com/gardenlinux/gardenlinux/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml). For details on the publishing process, check out the [upload action](https://github.com/gardenlinux/gardenlinux/blob/main/.github/workflows/upload_to_s3.yml) and the [gardenlinux/glci](https://github.com/gardenlinux/glci) repository.

## Tests

To run local tests for a specific target, use the command `./test ${target}`.

### Platform Tests
Garden Linux supports platform tests for all major cloud platforms (Alicloud, AWS, Azure, GCP). To allow testing even without access to any cloud platform we created an universal `kvm` platform that may run locally and is accessed in the same way via a `ssh client object` as any other cloud platform. Therefore, you do not need to adjust tests to perform  tests locally. This platform is used to perform `unit tests` and will run as a local `integration test`. More details can be found within the documentation in  [tests/README.md](tests/README.md).
